### ANNOUNCEMENT

Currently inactive. For whatever purpose, contact with email or others, at least not on GitHub.

### âœ¨About My Self

Nothing special but mainly making my way. Sometimes attach my consideration to something interesting.
Anything interesting could be what I may join. Anything useful could be what I may learn.
Anyway, I would always be here to be talked!
